# Service-Exchange

## Overview
"Service Exchange" is an innovative online platform developed as part of the **Innovating for Resilience: Empowering Humans** Hackathon. It's designed to facilitate the exchange of services without the need for monetary transactions. This platform addresses a common issue where many individuals require services that are beyond their financial reach, while simultaneously possessing skills and services that others find valuable. By enabling users to directly connect their needs with others' abilities, "Service Exchange" fosters a more collaborative and economical ecosystem. The platform targets a diverse audience, including individuals, small to medium-sized businesses, non-profit organizations, and students, aiming to enhance accessibility and community cooperation.
